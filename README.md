# (GitHub Copilot
# Both CSV and JSON files have their own advantages and can be used effectively for storing questions and answers for a flashcard quiz app. Here are some considerations for each:
# CSV
# Pros:
# Simple and easy to read/write.
# Well-suited for tabular data.
# Can be easily edited with spreadsheet software like Excel.
# Cons:
# Limited to flat data structures.
# Less flexible for complex data.
# JSON
# Pros:
# Supports nested data structures.
# More flexible and can represent complex relationships.
# Widely used in web applications and APIs.
# Cons:
# Slightly more complex to read/write compared to CSV.
# Not as easily editable with spreadsheet software.
# Recommendation
# If your questions and answers are simple and can be represented in a tabular format, a CSV file might be more straightforward. However, if you need to store more complex data (e.g., multiple choice options, hints, etc.), JSON would be a better choice.
# Example Structures
# CSV
# JSON
# Choose the format that best fits your needs and the complexity of your data. If you need further assistance with implementing either format, feel free to ask!)

# fix the code of file main.py. (There was an error with the main.py code because the file flashcards.json was not made yet)

# Make the edits in flashcards.json so that the main.py code will work (After I made the flashcards.json file, I told the AI to edit the neew file so it fixes the main.py code.)

# Make sure the code displays a flashcard wiht a question on the front, there is a flip button that reveals the answers, there is a next and previous button so you can move through the flashcards, there is a shuffle function to randomize card order, and load questions & answers from a JSON file.
